  # Fix Essay Grades RLS Policies for AI Grading

  1. Problem
    - Current RLS policies on essay_grades table are too restrictive
    - They rely on auth.uid() which doesn't work with our custom authentication
    - AI grading system cannot insert grades due to policy violations

  2. Solution
    - Drop existing restrictive policies
    - Create new permissive policies that work with custom authentication
    - Allow authenticated users to insert/update grades with proper validation
    - Maintain security by validating essay_id exists and user permissions

  3. Changes
    - Remove auth.uid() dependencies
    - Add policies that validate essay existence
    - Allow AI grading system to work properly
    - Maintain teacher and student access controls
